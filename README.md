# Memory Game

**Memory Game is a card matching game. The cards are shuffled and placed face-down on the board. Once a card is flipped, it remains flipped until a second card is turned over. If both of these cards match, they remain turned over otherwise, they are flipped back. This pattern continues until the user manages to flip and match all the cards on the screen.**

**The aim is to flip through the cards one by one while remembering if you came across a matching card at an earlier point in time so that you can match the entire deck more efficiently.**

**The move counter keeps track of the total number of cards you have flipped. At the conclusion of the game, you are awarded a star rating (out of 5) based on the number of moves it took to complete the game. A timer is also in place to keep track of the time it took to finish the game. All of this info is displayed in a modal window at the end.**
