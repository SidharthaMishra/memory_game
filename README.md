# Memory Game
___

**Memory Game is a game involving cards that need to be flipped over and matched. The cards are shuffled and placed randomly on the board. Once a card is flipped, it remains flipped until a second card is turned over. If both of the cards match, they remain turned over otherwise, they are flipped back. This pattern continues until all the cards on the screen have been successfully matched.**

**The aim is to flip through the cards one by one while remembering if you came across a match for the current card at an earlier point in time so that you can match them more efficiently.**

**The move counter keeps track of the total number of all cards you have flipped (not just the matching ones). At the conclusion of the game you are awarded a star rating (out of 5) based on the number of moves it took to complete the game. A timer is also in place to keep track of how long you needed to finish the game. All of this info is displayed inside a modal window upon the successful completion of the game.**
